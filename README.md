# OpenBible2
This project aims to provide the BIBLE with minimal distractions as an Android App.
It is a revamp of the old project [OpenBible](https://github.com/SchweGELBin/OpenBible).

## How does it work?
It is written in jetpack [compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform) and uses [Material You](https://m3.material.io) as its Design.
It downloads and works with json files, provided by [getbible](https://getbible.net/docs), which uses crosswire's [sword](https://www.crosswire.org/sword) module.
