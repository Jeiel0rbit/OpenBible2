# OpenBible
OpenBible provides the `bible` as a simple Android App.

## How does it work?
It is written in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) and uses [Material You](https://m3.material.io) as its Design.
It downloads and works with json files, provided by the [GETBIBLE API](https://getbible.net/docs) and the [CrossWire SWORD](https://www.crosswire.org/sword) project.
